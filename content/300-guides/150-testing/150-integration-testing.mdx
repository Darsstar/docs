This is the integration testing guide. Integration tests focus on testing how separate parts of the program work together. In the context of applications using a database, integration tests usually require a database to be available and contain data that is convenient to the scenarios intended to be tested.

- Short intro to integration testing, what it is, why its good etc..

Taking an e-commerce application example, an integration test could be checking that the order fulfillment flow is working properly. This means:

- Getting a fake order for a fake customer
- Submitting the order, checking for inventory
- Issuing an invoice
- Sending a confirmation email

That flow relies on the following data to be available in the database:

- 1 customer
- a few products with inventory and price information

The email service could be mocked for the sake of simplification.

- Example with Docker
- example with an local DB
